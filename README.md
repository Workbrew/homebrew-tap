# ☠️ Workbrew/tap (deprecated)

Was the external public tap for Workbrew.

No longer needed as it wasn't suitable for first-time install and Workbrew now auto-updates.

## How do I install these packages?

1. Book a demo to get access to Workbrew at <https://workbrew.com/demo>
1. Install the latest Workbrew Installer from <https://console.workbrew.com/downloads/macos>
